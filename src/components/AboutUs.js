      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>We've all had plants in our homes. For those who haven't experienced this sensation, if you are a beginner,
        majority of the time your plant will die. This is because you either drowned your poor plant in water, or made the plant think
        it was facing a drought due to the lack of water. Nonetheless, the level of moisture is not up to the standards of the plant.
        This is where we got our idea from, recently we've all had a plant die on us, and we became saddened by these unforeseen 
        circumstances. So we came up with a solution for our problem. By utilizing aurdino, sensors, and front end development tools, 
        we have created an efficient way to detect moisture levels. We call this system the Garden Angel, and we will show you how to
        use this.</p>
